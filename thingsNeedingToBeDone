Needed to finish the game:
- make more spawn patterns
- make timeline more detailed
- add various difficulty modes
- make menu better
-- add the title of the game
-- add highscore button
- make players able to put their names into the high score
- add death transition
-- your ship exploding if last hit was to you
-- wave of destruction from the back if too many ships escaped

Nice to have
- rework the density map so that it works using a grid rather than the mess of math that it currently is
- make missile explosion more flamboyant

Notes for next time:
-add laser sight for laser burst
--triggers when press down 'Q', gone when release
--make laser burst fire when 'Q' is released rather than pressed
-add laser sight
- make the player loose some small amount of health per collision but small enough that ramming occasionally is a valid choice
- add critical strikes which cause the explosion of the ship to be larger (both with graphics and with radius)
- add code to choose a random rotation for the explosions for extra variety
- remove duplicate numbers by universalizing explosion radius
-- remove Explosion.expRadiusArray or else make that the only spot their stored
- add try-catches around graphics to prevent an exception from killing the game
-- when the image is not found, set it to image not found image
- remove the need to have so many Controller.get calls by passing the things as arguments
- transfer all file reading tasks to FileUtil

Special actions: special things a player can do once a energy bar charges
--potentially can charge a few times then use multiple simultaneously
--different special actions could require different amounts of charge. MaxCharge value would have to be based on the maximum needed charge amount
--make it fire upon button release. holding button will show a tracer (e.g. laser burst would show a thin red laser showing where the burst will land)
-missile: explodes either on impact or by pressing the missile button again
-rail gun: tears through any enemies in the way (isn't destroyed on impact)
-ramming shield: allows player to ram ships without taking damage
-deflector shield: absorbs bullets
-burst: a burst centered on the player
-laser burst: lasers shoot out either side of the player for a second
-Mega burst: sends out a wave of destruction (would require the multiple charge thing and would take multiple charges)
-wave burst: sends a burst all the way across the screen pushing everything it touches away
-- would give the player a bit of extra time
-- potentially have things behind the player be pushed toward the left edge
--- or could have a thing where a couple things pop out the sides of the ship and emit the wave directionally but enemies behind just go at their normal pace


enemy types:
create a density map which can be used for ship navigation or for weighting spawns either to make it harder or easier
-Would also need density projection to predict where density will be after a certain amount of time
-shooter: shoots stun shots
-spawn ship: spawns ships (probably movers of some type so not all clumped up because that would just result in a massive explosion when the cluster got hit (that could be rather fun though))
-mover: goes up and down
--could move to a pattern or by choosing the next point to move toward by picking low density holes near high density patches to enable better chains
---if moved to optimize chains, would need to only do so every few moves else seem to easy
---or could intentionally pass through those spots rather than going to them to reward foresight
-armored: immune to explosions
-armored2: immune to guns (only killable with explosions)
-armored3: has multiple points of health
-cluster: a group of enemies spawned together
-fighter: intelligent enemy which moves around to stay on screen, not get hit, and shoot at player
-shielder: shields itself and any ships within range (player must go inside shield to destroy)
-bosses of various kinds
-health dropping ship
-enemy that fires an emp blasts which would temporarily freeze your ship (or makes your ship go bezerk)
	-would give you something to restrict your motion

visuals:
-maybe make the fuel ship less garishly bright
-animate laser burst
-make the background scroll
-- maybe with parallax


Menu Upgrade Selections:
-could have multiple upgrade options from which the player can choose a limited number for the round
-could also select which special abilities you want to use
-upgrade ideas:
--increased fire rate
--piercing rounds (ignore shields)
--cannon: player fires slower but explosive rounds
--firing laser sight: a laser sight for the front facing gun
--spread shot: firing shoots a spread of bullets

Mary Feedback:
-increase fire rate
-triple ship size (so can see where you are more easily)
-decrease special attack rate
-add allies
	-can call up up to a certain number of squadrons per game
		-could have different types that you call call up
		-could regain call ups at certain point levels (or times)
	-friend ship could spawn on the right (being attacked by enemies) would need to protect, once gets to left get more squadron calls
-MT: need to increase health
-add spawn patterns
	-makes clumps etc
-have more variety of ships even for the generics (maybe color code the different speeds)
-cloked ship with only an outline (larger, takes more hits)
-enemy ship that freezes you (either your firing or your motion)
-ship which when hit breaks into smaller ships
