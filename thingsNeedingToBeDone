Special actions: special things a player can do once a energy bar charges
--potentially can charge a few times then use multiple simultaniously
--make it fire upon button realease. holding button will show a tracer (e.g. laser blast would show a thin red laser showing where the blast will land)
-missle: explodes either on impact or by pressing the missle button again
-rail gun: tears through any enemies in the way (isn't destroyed on impact)
-ramming shield: allows player to ram ships without taking damage
-deflector shield: absorbs bullets
-burst: a blast centered on the player
-laser blast: lasers shoot out either side of the player for a second
-Mega burst: sends out a wave of destruction (would require the multiple charge thing and would take multiple charges)


enemy types:
-shooter: shoots
-spawn ship: spawns ships (probably movers of some type so not all clumped up because that would just result in a massive explosion when the cluster got hit (that could be rather fun though))
-mover: goes up and down
-armored: immune to explosions
-armored2: immune to guns (only killable with explosions)
-armored3: has multiple points of health
-formation: a group of enemies spawned together
-figher: intellegent enemy which moves around to stay on screen, not get hit, and shoot at player
-shielder: shields itself and any ships within range (player must go inside shield to destroy)
-bosses of various kinds

visuals:
-maybe make the fuel ship less garishly bright
-animate laser blast
-make the background scroll
-- maybe with paralax
