Special actions: special things a player can do once a energy bar charges
--potentially can charge a few times then use multiple simultaniously
-missle: explodes either on impact or by pressing the missle button again
-rail gun: tears through any enemies in the way (isn't destroyed on impact)
-ramming shield: allows player to ram ships without taking damage
-deflector shield: absorbs bullets


enemy types:
-shooter: shoots
-mover: goes up and down
-armored: immune to explosions
-armored2: immune to guns (only killable with explosions)
-armored3: has multiple points of health
-formation: a group of enemies spawned together
-figher: intellegent enemy which moves around to stay on screen, not get hit, and shoot at player
-shielder: shields itself and any ships within range (player must go inside shield to destroy)
-bosses of various kinds


add an overheat bar which indicates when the player can fire
- maybe make it so the player can fire a series of a few bullets before overheat.
---Rather than just one-wait-one-wait... would be -fire-fire-fire-wait-fire-fire-fire...

visuals:
-maybe make the fuel ship less garishly bright
-make the background scroll
-- maybe with paralax
