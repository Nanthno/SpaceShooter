Notes for next time:
-add toString methods to the spawn classes and test their functionality (specifically SpawnUtil.createSpawnClusters)
-add pattern files and functionality to read them
-make the spawn controller be used to spawn enemies rather than the radomized one in controller


Special actions: special things a player can do once a energy bar charges
--potentially can charge a few times then use multiple simultaniously
--make it fire upon button realease. holding button will show a tracer (e.g. laser blast would show a thin red laser showing where the blast will land)
-missle: explodes either on impact or by pressing the missle button again
-rail gun: tears through any enemies in the way (isn't destroyed on impact)
-ramming shield: allows player to ram ships without taking damage
-deflector shield: absorbs bullets
-burst: a blast centered on the player
-laser blast: lasers shoot out either side of the player for a second
-Mega burst: sends out a wave of destruction (would require the multiple charge thing and would take multiple charges)


enemy types:
-shooter: shoots
-spawn ship: spawns ships (probably movers of some type so not all clumped up because that would just result in a massive explosion when the cluster got hit (that could be rather fun though))
-mover: goes up and down
-armored: immune to explosions
-armored2: immune to guns (only killable with explosions)
-armored3: has multiple points of health
-formation: a group of enemies spawned together
-figher: intellegent enemy which moves around to stay on screen, not get hit, and shoot at player
-shielder: shields itself and any ships within range (player must go inside shield to destroy)
-bosses of various kinds
-health dropping ship
-enemy that fires an emp blasts which would temporarily freeze your ship (or makes your ship go bezerk)
	-would give you something to restrict your motion

visuals:
-maybe make the fuel ship less garishly bright
-animate laser blast
-make the background scroll
-- maybe with paralax


Mary Feedback:
-increase fire rate
-triple ship size (so can see where you are more easily)
-decrease special attack rate
-add allies
	-can call up up to a certain number of squadrons per game
		-could have different types that you call call up
		-could regain call ups at certain point levels (or times)
	-friend ship could spawn on the right (being attacked by enemies) would need to protect, once gets to left get more squadron calls
-MT: need to increase health
-add spawn patterns
	-makes clumps etc
-have more variety of ships even for the generics (maybe color code the different speeds)
-cloked ship with only an outline (larger, takes more hits)
-enemy ship that freezes you (either your firing or your motion)
-ship which when hit breaks into smaller ships
