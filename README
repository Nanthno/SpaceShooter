#Running Instructions
Run the jar file called SpaceShooter.jar
If issues arise due to null pointer exceptions,
it is very likely that you are missing the resources file needed.
There must be a resources file in the same directory as the jar file.
If you are missing this file, please redownload it from whatever source you got it originally

#Making Your Own Modifications
As the resource file is external to the jar file, it is very easy to modify things.
If changing the images, please note that the directory structure is very specific and any modification to it may cause issues.
Also, if you change the images for the items, note that it may cause issues to replace it with an image of different dimensions.
To make different spawn structures and rates, follow the descriptions in the appropriate files to make a valid file.
Audio changes should not cause any issues.

#On the Experiential Audio Option
Many may wonder at the "Experiential" audio option on the menu.
All audio (except the music, although that may change) is recordings of my voice.
"Why does this exist?" you may ask (and with very good reason). Well, I was explaining my game idea to a friend and she recommended this so I made it a thing.


#On Reskins
In making these resources external, I realize that reskins of this game are extremely easy.
I have no opposition to you reskinning this game and publishing it as long as
a) you do not claim the game as your own (although you may claim whatever changes you made)
b) you give credit to me, Anthony Hanson, as the original creator
c) if you are reskinning a reskin, please give credit to the original reskinner (to make this possible, please add your name and modifications at the bottom of this file under the reskin info section.)

#Reskin Info
[This is the original version of the game with no modifications. If you do a reskin, please list your name or psodoname and any modifications you made and remove this line]
