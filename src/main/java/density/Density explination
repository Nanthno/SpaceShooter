the density map is to track where enemy ships are densest to aid in dynamic motion and spawning so that the difficulty can be tweaked

the density map itself is a collection of locations and weights for that location
the weight for each location is determined by how many ships are within or near exploding radius, the further away the ship is, the less density is added
Using this method, each enemy ship's location will have a density value

Using the map, a density hole map would be created by finding places where ships are just outside each other's explosion radii
The weight on the holes would be calculated as a function of the near by ship's densities
- this can be used by ships like the agile which seek out and move toward holes allowing the player to get larger combos
