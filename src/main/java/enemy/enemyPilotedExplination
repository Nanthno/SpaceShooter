The piloted enemy will fly around to stay on the screen and attack the player

Movement:
The ship will pick what position it want to go to then set its speeds accordingly
Position Picking:
x: the ship will have an ideal amount of distance between itself and the player with a tolerance so that it doesn't follow the player exactly
y: the ship will choose the same y as the player if he is not moving; if the player is moving, it will lead ahead of the player
with those in place, it will check the density map to see if those are away from other ships.
- if it is too close to another ship, it will change the x position to a more open space  or if necessary the y position

Firing:
when the ship is within a certain tolerance of it's chosen position, it will open fire with a burst of fire of a few rounds, then a delay, then another burst, etc
