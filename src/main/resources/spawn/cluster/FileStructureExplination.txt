cluster id based on the file name
spacing is how far apart each point represents
speed is the default speed range of the ships (upper/lower range sperated with comma)
speed override is a boolean. if true, nested clusters' speed = speed
grid is the way of storing the ships' locations relative to each other.
-each character is separated by a space unless another cluster is being used
- any nested clusters are centered around the point at which they are placed
if notes are desired, they can be placed after an optional 'END' line
Example
______________________________________________________________________
spacing:10
speed:5,6
b . . b . . b
. . . . . . .
. . . f . . BB
. . . . . . .
b . . b . . b
END

the above file would create a cluster of ships with a fuel ship in the center with six basic ships flanking it and cluster BB at the back
