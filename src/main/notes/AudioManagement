This system uses the TinyAudio package

Java does not handle audio very well and so I had to use a few tricks to reduce the amount of audio played at any given moment.

1) audio collapsing
since many ships can be destroyed with one explosion (and thus, in one frame), the system counts the number of times a given sound is played per frame and thus doesn't play the same clip several times simultaneously. Instead, it collects them and plays them as a group (potentially with a proportional volume boost)
2) audio frame reduction
it only plays the collapsed audio file every other frame in the game
3) repetition delay
whenever a sound is played, it sets its corosponding map value to the frame upon which is was played. Whenever a new play request comes in, it first checks to see if that clip has been played recently and if so, it skips it
This reduces the number of total clips playing thus improving performance and reducing chaos in the soundscape
